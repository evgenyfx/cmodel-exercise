# Image-filter C-model project

C++17 host/device simulation with a histogram-based median filter, C99 reference filters, and monochrome Y4M input/output. See [EXERCISES.md](EXERCISES.md) for the tasks and [REGISTER_MAP.md](REGISTER_MAP.md) for the device interface.

## Build on Linux

Requires CMake 3.16+, a C99/C++17 compiler, and Make. From the project directory:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build
```

## Run samples and tests

From the project directory:

```sh
./build/median_demo data/lena_mono.y4m 1 result
./build/sobel_reference_demo data/lena_mono.y4m 0.7 edges_reference.y4m
./build/median_tests
```

- `median_demo [input.y4m] [radius] [output-prefix]`: compares device and reference pixels; the optional prefix saves `result_device.y4m` and `result_reference.y4m` in this example. Defaults: supplied image, radius 1, no files. The starter intentionally reports mismatches and exits with code 1 (exercise 1).
- `sobel_reference_demo [input.y4m] [gain] [output.y4m]`: runs the floating-point reference and saves a rounded 8-bit preview. Defaults: supplied image, gain 1, `sobel_reference.y4m`.
- `median_tests`: runs all registered tests without arguments; exits with 0 on success or 1 on failure. The starter only checks device creation/destruction. Add tests in `tests/median_tests.cpp`.

## Y4M API

The `y4m_io` library exposes these functions in [include/y4m.h](include/y4m.h) for 8-bit monochrome (`Cmono`) images:

- `read_y4m(path, image, error)`: loads the first frame into `MonoImage` (`width`, `height`, packed `pixels`).
- `write_y4m(path, pixels, width, height, stride, error)`: writes one frame, omitting row padding. Stride is in bytes; the buffer must contain at least `(height - 1) * stride + width` bytes.

Both return `bool` and report failures through `error`. The supplied input is 512 × 512; see [data/README.md](data/README.md) for provenance.
